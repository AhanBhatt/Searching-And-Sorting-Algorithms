    <br><h1>Searching and Sorting algorithms</h1>
    <p>
        Sorting and Searching is one of the most vital topic in Data Structure. Storing and retrieving information is one of the most common application of computers now-a-days. According to time the amount of data and information stored and accessed via computer has turned to huge databases. So many techniques and algorithms have been developed to efficiently maintain and process information in databases. The processes of looking up a particular data record in the database is called searching. The process of ordering the records in a database is called Sorting. Sorting and searching together constitute a major area of study in computational methods. Both of them are very important field of study in data structure and algorithms.

        What is searching?
    </h1>
    <p>
        Searching is the process of finding a particular item in a collection of items. A search typically answers whether the item is present in the collection or not. Searching requires a key field such as name, ID, code which is related to the target item. When the key field of a target item is found, a pointer to the target item is returned. The pointer may be an address, an index into a vector or array, or some other indication of where to find the target. If a matching key field isnâ€™t found, the user is informed.

        What is sorting?
    </h1>
    <p>
        Sorting is the process of placing elements from a collection in some kind of order. For example, a list of words could be sorted alphabetically or by length. Efficient sorting is important to optimize the use of other algorithms that require sorted lists to work correctly.
